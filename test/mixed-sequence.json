The private performance on Wednesday was one of six in the New York trial run of Musicians on Call, a London Symphony program that takes music to the homebound.</p>\n        <p>Using a walker, Mr. Marks settled into a chair alongside his wife and three friends, and peered intently through horn-rimmed glasses as Hilary Jones, a cellist, and Robert Turner, a violist, unpacked their instruments and began to play. There were short works by Bach and Haydn, the melancholy ''June'' from Tchaikovsky's ''Seasons,'' and rousing selections from Bartok's ''Music for Children,'' interspersed with chit-chat about music and an instrument show-and-tell.</p>\n        <p>And then there was the lively tune by Dittersdorf, whose theme was reminiscent of a phrase in Mozart's ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' -- though no one in the room, not even the musicians, could remember exactly how the Mozart excerpt went.</p>\n        <p>''He can't walk very well, and he has dementia, and I can't really take him out at night,'' Ms. Marks, 82, said of her husband, a former writer. ''I brought Beethoven to the relationship, and he brought Mozart. We attended concerts regularly, and he misses them, and I miss them.''</p>\n        <p>Promoted by WNYC-FM to coincide with the orchestra's ninth annual residency at Lincoln Center, Musicians on Call asked listeners to explain in a brief essay why a friend or family member deserved a house concert by one of three duos from the orchestra. The station received about 100 entries, and winners were chosen based on the nature of their situation and how integral music was to their lives, as well as for diversity, said Stacy Wilson Margolis, executive director of the orchestra's American Foundation.</p>\n        <p>Since 2004, Musicians on Call has regularly serenaded those in Britain unable to attend concerts and, according to its mission statement, draws on scientific research that suggests that listening to live music lowers blood pressure, anxiety and depression.</p>\n        <p>The orchestra seems eager to establish a footing in New York, where it spends about 10 days a year, and its members are starting to treat the city as a second home.</p>\n        <p>''When you're getting to know the city a little bit better, you naturally want to do more for its residents and establish some continuity,'' Mr. Turner said.</p>\n        <p>Matthew Gibson, a double bassist and vice chairman of the orchestra's board of directors, said half the 100-member orchestra participated at least once a season in its large education program, which includes Musicians on Call. Performers are paid about $150 for one of these appearances, slightly more than a rehearsal fee.</p>\n        <p>''I think the mentality of classical musicians is changing,'' Mr. Gibson said. ''Today players are coming out of conservatories with the idea that working in the community is actually part of the musicians' life, rather than just playing in the orchestra.''</p>\n        <p>To any cynics who might accuse the orchestra of clever promotion for plying a foreign market with a service that its homegrown organizations have failed to provide, Mr. Gibson added, ''Yes, we want to develop an artistic impact when we come here, but for a musician it's very, very rewarding, seeing what pleasure music gives individuals face to face.''</p>\n        <p>''It's fantastic playing on a stage in front of 2,000 people, but you don't get to meet your audience, spend the afternoon with them, play and chat and hear their stories and tell them ours,'' he said.</p>\n        <p>Dina Paisner nominated for the program her friend Jean Murai, 90, a Greenwich Village fixture who stopped going to concerts when she lost her vision.</p>\n        <p>''It was so overwhelming to have that music right in your heart and your face and coming through the wooden floor,'' Ms. Paisner said. ''We're still in a state of euphoria.''</p>\n        <p>So is Joe Karten, a 41-year-old trumpeter and composer in Jackson Heights, Queens, who is recuperating from a herniated disk and listened to his recital while lying on his back.</p>\n        <p>''After not being able to perform or practice for over a month, to have two wonderful musicians in my home reawakened me to the possibilities of music again,'' he said, adding that he intended to write a piece for the Musicians on Call repertory.</p>\n        <p>But perhaps the greatest testament came from a man for whom words no longer flow and memory is an increasing blur.</p>\n        <p>In a pause near the end of the recital, Mr. Marks, a sudden look of recognition on his face, began to sing the elusive Mozart theme from ''Eine Kleine Nachtmusik'' that no one else was able to recall.</p>\n        <p>As Ms. Jones and Mr. Turner set down their instruments, Mr. Marks applauded.</p>\n        <p>''Beautiful,'' he said quietly.</p>\n      </block>\n    </body.content>\n  </body>\n</nitf>"
